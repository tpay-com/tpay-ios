/// The `CertificatePinningConfiguration` struct represents a configuration for certificate pinning, a security mechanism that ensures secure communication between an app and a server by verifying the server's certificate against pre-defined public key hashes.
///
/// This configuration specifies the domain to which the pinning is applied and the array of public key hashes that the server's certificate must match.
/// - Important: Certificate pinning enhances security by mitigating the risks of man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring the authenticity of the server.
/// - Warning: Ensure that the public key hashes are accurate and up-to-date, as incorrect hashes can lead to communication failures.
